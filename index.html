        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, My name is Gabriel Sanchez, and I am a student at UCR. I am majoring in political science and hope to become a teacher and track coach at Perris High School. I am the first person in my family ever to attend college, and I hope to set a positive influence for future generations. I have years of work experience in the educational sector, specifically as a high school track coach and Promise Program mentor. I pride myself on giving students the resources in order to become successful. As a track coach at Perris High School, I hope to influence as many students and break the vicious cycle that has spread across my low-income community. With hard work and determination, I hope to achieve a better life for my family. Life is short, so I need to make the most of it for my family that has given me everything in life. 
   <br><br>
        As a Promise Program mentor at Riverside City College, I was responsible for helping and assisting about fifteen mentees. I would have to inform and encourage them about attending lectures and workshops. We had to check in with mentees on a regular basis, either in person or through email. My other duties were also to refer my mentees to campus resources if they ever needed help. These are just a few of the many responsibilities that I was reasonable for as a mentor. Seeing my mentees succeed in their courses and grow as a person was a fantastic experience. This job allowed me to use my leadership skills in order to positively impact RCC students. 
<br><br>

        I am currently working as a high school track coach, and I have gained many valuable skills that will benefit me in future endeavors. I am responsible for developing students, athletically, and academically. I help improve a competitive environment while also teaching them about ethical behavior and sportsmanship. As their leader, it is crucial to teach them leadership skills that will help them outside of school. Communication is essential in this environment because it will either advance the team's objectives or destroy it before it even began. I also actively developed my teamwork skills because it was essential to always be on the same page with my fellow coaches. Without a functioning organization, the team will not be successful. The most important skill I developed was leadership qualities. As a head coach, everyone on the team looks at you for everything happening on the team. If you make one mistake, it will affect every single individual on the team. I always learned to be responsible and be able to access every situation. I am able to work under pressure and come up with the best possible solutions. I have reached high levels of leadership, communication, and teamwork during my work as a high school track coach.
